topic: Waveform Generation
description: >
    Many music applications have waveforms as a nice-to-have design fature, but for Soundstripe's customers who create video content, not having waveforms means having to constantly click through songs to analyze dynamics and crescendo length. With waveforms, a customer is able to see the entire flow of a song at a glance, to quickly vet songs. However, this isn't as easy or as straightforward as it sounds. There are a multitude of ways to generate and display waveforms to a user, and Trevor is joining us to walk you through what has worked for Soundstripe's engineering team, what hasn't, and even sharing some of the tools they've open-sourced so you don't have the reinvent the wheel when it comes to audio waveform generation
