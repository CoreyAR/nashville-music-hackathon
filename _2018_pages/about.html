    <h2 class="second">Who</h2>
    <p>
      Nashville Music Tech was founded in 2014 as a meetup for technolgists and music professionals to discuss and learn about
      how the future of the music industry. The organization's mission is to create educational and professional opportunties
      around the confluence of music and technology. In 2017, the focus shifted to an annual hackathon.
    </p>
    <h2 class="second">What</h2>
    <p>
      The Nashville Music Hackathon is a free all day event. The day starts with several short educational presentations before
      shifting to working on projects. Hacking starts with an open mic so participants can share what they will be working
      on, followed by a period to network and form groups. At the end of the day, everyone will have an opportunity to present
      what they created.
    </p>
    <h2 class="second">When</h2>
    <p>
      The hackathon is a volunteer effort and is organized as people have bandwidth. Usually the event happens once a year in the
      spring.
    </p>
    <h2 class="second">Where</h2>
    <p>
      Check the event information for the location. It is always held somewhere with workspaces (tables / chairs), electric outlets,
      and a projector / sound system. Please
      <a href="#contact"></a>reach out</a> if you are interested in hosting us.
    </p>
    <h2 class="second">Why</h2>
    <p>
      In short, because we love music and technology as creative, expressive, and challening endeavors. Technology has always been
      a driver of music from how we create it to how we consume. Hackathons are an interdisciplinary opportunity to explore
      problems and create solutions.
